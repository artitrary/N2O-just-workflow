# PM Agent (Planning Agent)

## Overview

**Audience**: PM role (planning, not implementation)

This skill guides the feature-to-tasks lifecycle:
- Create feature specs from ideas
- **Verify specs before tasks** (audit code, MECE, sizing)
- Break specs into executable tasks (SQLite)
- Set up dependencies and sprint structure
- Start implementation with `/tdd-agent`
- Monitor sprint progress and unblock tasks

**Key principle**: PM plans and orchestrates, implementation uses `tdd-agent`.

### Phases (Planning Agent Only)

| Phase | Name | Key Action |
|-------|------|------------|
| 1 | Ideation | Capture in `.wm/` or `backlog/` |
| 1.5 | Audit Code | Check what exists before speccing |
| 2 | Refinement | Write specs in `todo/` |
| **2.5** | **Pre-Task Checklist** | **Audit → Patterns → MECE → Verify** |
| 3 | Sprint Planning | Break into tasks → SQLite |
| **3.5** | **Post-Load Audit** | **Dependencies → Orphans → Cycles → Coverage** |
| **4** | **Start Implementation** | **Begin tasks with `/tdd-agent`** |
| **5** | **Monitor Sprint** | **Track progress, unblock tasks** |
| **6** | **Sprint Completion** | **Verify, clean up, close sprint** |

**Note**: Implementation uses the `tdd-agent` skill (main chat or parallel tabs as needed).

---

## Workflow (Planning Agent)

```
.wm/ (scratch) → backlog/ (idea) → todo/ (spec) → VERIFY → tasks.db → AUDIT → generate dev prompt
                                         ↑                      ↑              ↓
                                   Pre-Task Checklist    Post-Load Audit    dev agents
                                   (patterns, MECE)      (deps, orphans)    (tdd-agent)
```

**Dev agents** then implement tasks in parallel using `tdd-agent` skill.

| Stage | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Scratch** | `.wm/` | Transitory brainstorming, context dumps |
| **Backlog** | `.pm/backlog/**/*.md` | Raw ideas, someday items |
| **Todo** | `.pm/todo/**/*.md` | Active sprint specs |
| **Pre-Verify** | Pre-Task Checklist | Audit, patterns, MECE, user approval |
| **Tasks** | `.pm/tasks.db` | Executable work items |
| **Post-Verify** | Post-Load Audit | Dependencies, orphans, cycles, coverage |
| **Dev Agents** | Separate tabs | Execute tasks using `tdd-agent` |
| **Done** | Delete the spec | Git history preserves it |

---

## Directory Structure

```
.pm/
├── schema.sql            # Schema (in git)
├── tasks.db              # Local working db (gitignored)
├── backlog/              # Ideas (unrefined)
│   └── {group}/
├── todo/                 # Active sprint specs + task seeds
│   ├── crm/
│   │   ├── 01-deals-pipeline.md
│   │   ├── ...
│   │   └── tasks.sql     # Task seed for this sprint (in git)
│   └── domain-events/
│       └── tasks.sql
└── case-studies/         # User research

.wm/                      # Working memory (transitory, gitignored)
```

**Key design**: `tasks.sql` seeds live with their specs (diffable, in git). `tasks.db` is gitignored — no merge conflicts.

---

## Phase 1: Ideation

**Trigger**: User research, feature request, brainstorm

**Action**: Capture in `.wm/` (scratch) or `.pm/backlog/` (keep)

**Format**: Loose, informal — one-liner to brain dump.

---

## Phase 1.5: Audit Current Code (CRITICAL)

**Before writing ANY spec, audit what already exists.**

This prevents:
- Proposing components that already exist
- Creating new packages when features can extend existing ones
- Over-engineering with redundant abstractions
- Specs that duplicate existing functionality

### Audit Checklist

```bash
# 1. Search for existing implementations
find packages -name "*.tsx" | xargs grep -l "ComponentName"
find apps -name "*.tsx" | head -20

# 2. Check package structure
ls -la packages/*/src/ 2>/dev/null || ls -la packages/*/

# 3. Look for existing hooks
grep -r "export function use" packages/ apps/

# 4. Check what's registered/exported
grep -r "export \*" packages/ apps/

# 5. Read existing implementations before proposing new ones
```

### What to Audit

| Before speccing... | Check these locations |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| UI components | `packages/design/components/`, `apps/*/app/components/` |
| Hooks | `packages/*/hooks/`, `apps/*/app/hooks/` |
| Server actions | `apps/*/app/actions/` or `packages/*/actions/` |
| API routes | `apps/*/app/api/` |

> **Note:** Update these paths as your project structure evolves. Currently, components are in `packages/design/components/` and app-specific code is in `apps/*/app/`.

### Update Specs, Don't Duplicate

If existing code covers 80% of a spec:
1. **Mark completed items** in "What's Done" section
2. **Reduce scope** to only the remaining work
3. **Delete the spec** if nothing remains

**Example**: Root interface spec proposed new package, but `Thread` component in `features-chat` already handles everything → delete the spec.

---

## Phase 2: Refinement → Spec

**Trigger**: Deciding to work on something

**Action**: Move from backlog to `.pm/todo/{group}/`, refine into spec.

**Spec is ready when**:
- Problem is clear
- Solution approach defined
- Acceptance criteria are testable

### Spec Template

```markdown
# [Feature Name]

**Status**: Not Started | In Progress | Done

---

## Scope

[Feature description in 1-2 sentences]

**This spec covers**:
- Component A
- Component B
- Behavior C

**Out of scope**:
- [Topic X] → `other-spec.md`
- [Topic Y] → `another-spec.md`

---

## What's Done

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Component A | ✅ |
| Component B | ⏳ |

---

## Suggested Tasks

| # | Task | Done When |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | Create X | X exists and works |
| 2 | Build Y | Y renders correctly |
| 3 | Wire Z | Z integrated, tests pass |

---

## References

- Related spec: `related-spec.md`
- Skill: `.claude/skills/{relevant-skill}`
```

### MECE Principle

Specs should be **Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive**:

- **No overlaps**: Each task belongs to exactly one spec
- **No gaps**: Together, specs cover the entire feature
- **Cross-reference**: Use "Out of scope → see X" to redirect

**Bad** (overlapping):
```
# 01-root-interface.md
Tasks: Layout, Composer, File upload, CSV parsing

# 02-attachments.md
Tasks: File upload, CSV parsing  ← OVERLAP!
```

**Good** (MECE):
```
# 01-root-interface.md
Tasks: Layout, Composer
Out of scope: File handling → 02-attachments.md

# 02-attachments.md
Tasks: File upload, context injection
Out of scope: Import logic → 03-import-agent.md
```

### Phased Work

For multi-phase features, use separate task tables:

```markdown
## Phase 1: Foundation

| # | Task | Done When |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | Create package | Build succeeds |
| 2 | Basic layout | Component renders |

---

## Phase 2: Features (depends on Phase 1)

| # | Task | Done When |
|---|------|-----------|
| 3 | Add streaming | Text streams |
| 4 | Add progress | Progress shows |
```

---

## Phase 2.5: Pre-Task Checklist

**Before translating specs into tasks, run this checklist.**

### Checklist

```
□ 1. AUDIT CODE
    - Spin up parallel subagents per spec area
    - What exists? Update "What's Done" sections
    - What's missing/blocked? Flag external deps
    - Where does code live? New package or extend existing?
    - Delete specs if 100% complete
    - Read existing hooks/utils before proposing new ones
    - Check what SDK/framework already provides

□ 2. PATTERN CHECK
    - Spin up subagent to check specs against .claude/skills/
    - Do tasks follow existing patterns? (hooks, components, actions)
    - Are we duplicating something that already exists?

□ 3. MECE CHECK
    - No overlaps between specs
    - Cross-refs for out-of-scope items

□ 4. VERIFY WITH USER
    - Task count reasonable? (50-100 ideal, flexible)
    - Scope approved?
    - Ready to load?
```

### Task Quality Checks

Before loading to SQLite:

| Check | Bad | Good |
|-------|-----|------|
| Done When | "works", "done" | See "Done When" examples below |
| Task size | Multi-day epic | One session (see sizing guide) |
| Description | "as discussed" | Standalone context |
| Dependencies | Spec-level | Task-level |

### "Done When" Examples

**Pure logic / utilities**:
- Bad: "Parses CSV", "works"
- Good: "Unit test passes, returns headers + first N rows"

**UI components**:
- Bad: "Component renders"
- Good: "Component renders with mock data, Storybook story added"

**Hooks**:
- Bad: "Hook works"
- Good: "Hook returns expected state, unit test passes"

**Integrations**:
- Bad: "Wired up"
- Good: "Manual verification: action triggers expected behavior"

**Server actions / tools**:
- Bad: "Creates investors"
- Good: "Integration test passes, creates investors in DB"

### Task Sizing Guide

**Target: 2-4 tasks per spec.** Each spec should have exactly 2-4 tasks. If you have more, combine related work. If you have fewer, consider if the spec is too small.

**E2E specs: Single task.** All E2E verification for a sprint should be ONE task, not split by feature.

**One session** = 1-4 hours of focused work.

| Size | Example | Verdict |
|------|---------|---------|
| ✅ OK | "Create CRUD server actions for investors" | One pattern, 4-5 functions |
| ✅ OK | "Create 4 components for investor domain" | Same structure, different data |
| ✅ OK | "Remove Mastra wrapper + sync persistence" | Linear sequence, same concern |
| ⚠️ Split | "Build investor import with preview, validation, creation" | 3 distinct phases with different concerns |
| ❌ Epic | "Implement agent progress UI" | Entire spec, not a task |
| ❌ Over-split | 9 tasks for one spec | Combine into 2-4 larger tasks |

### When to Split vs Combine

**Combine into ONE task** when steps are:
- Linear sequence (A → B → C, no branching)
- Same concern/domain
- No external dependencies between steps
- Natural stopping point only at the end

**Split into MULTIPLE tasks** when:
- Steps can be done in parallel
- Different people could work on them
- External dependency between steps (e.g., needs API before UI)
- Natural stopping points exist

### Example: Refactoring

**Bad** (over-split):
```
| 1 | Investigate extraction feasibility | Decision doc |
| 2 | Extract createAgentTransport utility | Utility + tests |
| 3 | Extract useThreadId hook | Hook + tests |
| 4 | Simplify useAgentChat | Main hook ~100 lines |
```
These are a linear sequence with no branching. One task.

**Good** (single task):
```
| 1 | Refactor useAgentChat into smaller units | Extract transport + threadId hooks, ~100 lines, tests pass |
```

**Why?** When visualized as a dependency graph, linear sequences have no interconnections. They're one unit of work.

---

## Phase 3: Sprint Planning

**Trigger**: Starting new sprint (after Pre-Task Checklist passes)

**Actions**:
1. Pick spec(s) from `todo/` — multiple specs per sprint is normal
2. Write `tasks.sql` in the sprint folder (e.g., `.pm/todo/crm/tasks.sql`)
3. Initialize local db from schema + seed(s)

**Task granularity**: One session. Each task should be completable in a single focused work session.

### Initialize Local Database

```bash
# Fresh start (loads schema + all active sprints)
sqlite3 .pm/tasks.db < .pm/schema.sql
sqlite3 .pm/tasks.db < .pm/todo/crm/tasks.sql
sqlite3 .pm/tasks.db < .pm/todo/domain-events/tasks.sql

# Add new sprint tasks (keeps existing progress)
sqlite3 .pm/tasks.db < .pm/todo/new-sprint/tasks.sql
```

### Writing tasks.sql

**PM writes tasks as INSERT statements** in `.pm/todo/{sprint}/tasks.sql`. Lives with specs.

```sql
-- .pm/todo/crm/tasks.sql
INSERT INTO tasks (sprint, spec, task_num, title, type, owner, skills, done_when, description) VALUES
('crm-foundation', '01-deals-pipeline.md', 1, 'Create CRM tasks table', 'database', 'adam', 'database',
  'Migration runs, RLS policies pass pgTap (positive + negative cases)',
  'Build tasks table for human-in-the-loop agent approvals.');

INSERT INTO task_dependencies (sprint, task_num, depends_on_sprint, depends_on_task) VALUES
('crm-foundation', 2, 'crm-foundation', 1);  -- task 2 depends on task 1
```

**Column formats**:
- `sprint`: Sprint name (e.g., `'crm-foundation'`)
- `spec`: Spec file name (e.g., `'01-deals-pipeline.md'`)
- `task_num`: Sequential number within sprint (1, 2, 3...)
- `type`: Task layer — one of: `database`, `actions`, `frontend`, `infra`, `agent`, `e2e`, `docs`
- `owner`: Engineer assigned (e.g., `'ada'`, `'adam'`)
- `skills`: Comma-separated skills to invoke (e.g., `'database'`, `'server-actions, tanstack-hooks'`)

### Task Description Standard

**Tasks must be executable in isolation.** Include enough context that someone unfamiliar with the spec can complete the task without asking questions.

Good:
```
Add RLS policy for investors table. Users should only see investors
belonging to their company. Pattern: see existing policy on batches table.
```

Bad:
```
Add RLS policy as discussed.
```

### Setting Dependencies

```bash
# Create tasks with explicit task_num
sqlite3 .pm/tasks.db "INSERT INTO tasks (sprint, task_num, title) VALUES
  ('agent', 1, 'Write RLS policy for investors'),
  ('agent', 2, 'Create getInvestor server action'),
  ('agent', 3, 'Build InvestorDetail component');"

# Task 2 depends on 1, Task 3 depends on 2 (within same sprint)
sqlite3 .pm/tasks.db "INSERT INTO task_dependencies VALUES
  ('agent', 2, 'agent', 1),
  ('agent', 3, 'agent', 2);"
```

### E2E Spec (One Per Sprint)

**CRITICAL**: Implementation specs do NOT include E2E tasks.

Each sprint gets ONE E2E spec that runs after all implementation is complete.

**Structure**:
```
.pm/todo/<sprint>/
├── 01-feature-a.md      # Implementation spec
├── 02-feature-b.md      # Implementation spec
├── ...
└── 99-e2e-verification.md   # E2E spec (runs last)
```

**E2E Spec Creation**:
1. Create `99-e2e-verification.md` during sprint planning
2. Leave tasks section minimal initially
3. Populate tasks AFTER implementation specs are done
4. One E2E task per spec area (not per individual test)

**Template**: See `templates/e2e-spec.md`

**E2E Task Dependencies**:
```bash
# E2E task (last task in sprint) depends on all other tasks
# Example: E2E is task 51, depends on tasks 1-50
sqlite3 .pm/tasks.db "
  INSERT INTO task_dependencies (sprint, task_num, depends_on_sprint, depends_on_task)
  SELECT 'crm-foundation', 51, 'crm-foundation', task_num
  FROM tasks
  WHERE sprint = 'crm-foundation' AND task_num < 51;"
```

---

## Phase 3.5: Post-Load Audit

**Trigger**: Tasks loaded to SQLite, before starting implementation

**Actions**: Run subagent checks to verify task quality and dependencies.

### Audit Checklist

```
□ 1. DEPENDENCY AUDIT
    - Check available_tasks count vs total tasks
    - If >50% available immediately → missing dependencies
    - E2E tests MUST depend on features they test
    - Sequential work (sidebar → hooks → prompts → wire) needs ordering
    - Cross-spec dependencies captured (import agent → progress UI)

□ 2. ORPHAN CHECK
    - Tasks with no dependencies AND nothing depends on them
    - May be valid (standalone components) or missing links

□ 3. CYCLE CHECK
    - No circular dependencies (A → B → A)
    - SQLite won't catch this automatically

□ 4. COVERAGE CHECK
    - Every spec has tasks loaded
    - Task count matches spec's "Suggested Tasks" section
```

### Subagent Audit Script

```bash
# 1. Dependency ratio check
echo "=== Dependency Audit ==="
TOTAL=$(sqlite3 .pm/tasks.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tasks WHERE sprint = 'SPRINT';")
AVAILABLE=$(sqlite3 .pm/tasks.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM available_tasks WHERE sprint = 'SPRINT';")
RATIO=$(echo "scale=0; $AVAILABLE * 100 / $TOTAL" | bc)
echo "Available: $AVAILABLE / $TOTAL ($RATIO%)"
if [ "$RATIO" -gt 50 ]; then
  echo "⚠️  WARNING: >50% tasks have no dependencies - likely missing!"
fi

# 2. Orphan check (no deps in or out)
echo -e "\n=== Orphan Tasks ==="
sqlite3 -header -column .pm/tasks.db "
  SELECT task_num, substr(title, 1, 40) as title
  FROM tasks t
  WHERE sprint = 'SPRINT'
  AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM task_dependencies d WHERE d.sprint = t.sprint AND d.task_num = t.task_num)
  AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM task_dependencies d WHERE d.depends_on_sprint = t.sprint AND d.depends_on_task = t.task_num);
"

# 3. E2E test dependency check
echo -e "\n=== E2E Tests Without Dependencies ==="
sqlite3 -header -column .pm/tasks.db "
  SELECT task_num, substr(title, 1, 40) as title
  FROM tasks t
  WHERE sprint = 'SPRINT'
  AND title LIKE 'E2E%'
  AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM task_dependencies d WHERE d.sprint = t.sprint AND d.task_num = t.task_num);
"

# 4. Coverage check
echo -e "\n=== Tasks Per Spec ==="
sqlite3 -header -column .pm/tasks.db "
  SELECT spec_path, COUNT(*) as tasks FROM tasks
  WHERE sprint = 'SPRINT'
  GROUP BY spec_path;
"
```

### Common Dependency Patterns

| Pattern | Dependencies |
|---------|--------------|
| UI sequence | sidebar → hooks → prompts → wire page |
| Agent tools | agent definition → tools → registration |
| Components | schemas → individual components → component tests |
| E2E tests | feature implementation → E2E test for that feature |
| Cross-spec | Import Agent → Progress UI (shows agent working) |

### Fixing Missing Dependencies

```bash
# Add dependency (task 5 depends on task 3, same sprint)
sqlite3 .pm/tasks.db "INSERT INTO task_dependencies VALUES ('SPRINT', 5, 'SPRINT', 3);"

# Bulk add: E2E tests depend on wiring tasks
sqlite3 .pm/tasks.db "
  INSERT INTO task_dependencies (sprint, task_num, depends_on_sprint, depends_on_task)
  SELECT t.sprint, t.task_num, w.sprint, w.task_num
  FROM tasks t, tasks w
  WHERE t.title LIKE 'E2E%'
  AND w.title LIKE 'Wire % page%'
  AND t.sprint = w.sprint;
"
```

---

## Phase 4: Start Implementation

**Trigger**: Tasks loaded and audited, ready for implementation

**Goal**: Begin task implementation using `/tdd-agent`

### Execution Model

**Main chat handles implementation**. No separate "dev agent" tabs needed by default.

```bash
# Show available tasks to start
sqlite3 .pm/tasks.db "SELECT id, title, done_when FROM available_tasks WHERE sprint = 'SPRINT_NAME' LIMIT 10;"
```

Then invoke `/tdd-agent` and start implementing.

### Parallelism (Optional)

If multiple tasks from same spec can run concurrently:

| Scenario | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Sequential tasks (dependencies) | Stay in main chat |
| Parallel tasks (no dependencies) | User opens new tab, invokes `/tdd-agent` there |

**User decides** when to parallelize. Each tab runs its own tdd-agent independently.

### Quick Start

```
PM: "Tasks loaded. 10 available. Start with task #5 - Create parseCSVPreview utility."

User/Agent:
1. Invoke `/tdd-agent`
2. Pick task #5
3. Follow RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → AUDIT → CODIFY workflow
4. Complete task, pick next available task
5. Repeat until sprint complete
```

---

## Phase 4.5: Handle Future Enhancements (Discovered During Implementation)

**Trigger**: Discover future work while implementing tasks

**Protocol**: Ask user for approval, then add directly to spec and tasks.db

### Workflow

1. **Discover enhancement** during implementation
2. **Ask user for approval**:
   ```
   "Found potential enhancement: Add attachment metadata display in chat history.
   Should I add this to the spec and create a task? (Y/N)"
   ```
3. **If approved**:
   - Update spec with new item
   - Add task to tasks.db (see `templates/adding-tasks.md` for examples)
   - Set dependencies if needed
4. **If deferred**: Note in completion report, move on

### Example

```
Agent: "Discovered 2 potential enhancements:
1. UI preview of attachment context before sending (2 tasks)
2. Attachment metadata display in chat history (1 task)

Should I add these to the spec and create tasks?"

User: "Add #2, defer #1 to backlog"

Agent:
- Updates 01-attachments.md with item #2
- Adds task #69 to tasks.db
- Notes #1 in completion report for backlog
```

### Task Creation Reference

See `templates/adding-tasks.md` for:
- INSERT syntax for tasks.db
- Setting dependencies
- Linking to specs

---

## Code Review → Task Creation

**Trigger**: Reviewing code (PR review, commit review, architecture audit) and discovering issues

**Use case**: Tech debt, pattern violations, refactoring opportunities found during code review — not during implementation.

### When to Use

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Pattern violation in existing code | Create task in current sprint |
| Tech debt discovered in review | Create task, link to spec if exists |
| Audit finding (security, perf) | Create task with appropriate priority |
| Refactoring opportunity | Create task, set dependencies on affected work |

### Workflow

1. **Identify the issue** during code review
2. **Determine task details**:
   - Which sprint? (current sprint or create new)
   - Which spec? (existing or `NULL` for standalone)
   - Next task_num in that sprint
   - Type, skills, done_when
3. **Add task directly to tasks.db**:

```bash
# Find next task_num for sprint
sqlite3 .pm/tasks.db "SELECT MAX(task_num) + 1 FROM tasks WHERE sprint = 'SPRINT';"

# Add the task
sqlite3 .pm/tasks.db "INSERT INTO tasks (sprint, spec, task_num, title, type, skills, done_when, description) VALUES
('SPRINT', 'SPEC.md', TASK_NUM, 'TITLE', 'TYPE', 'SKILLS',
'DONE_WHEN',
'DESCRIPTION with context about why this was identified and what commit/code it relates to.');"
```

4. **Optionally persist to tasks.sql** (if task should be in git):

```bash
# Append to sprint's tasks.sql for persistence
echo "INSERT INTO tasks (...) VALUES (...);" >> .pm/todo/SPRINT/tasks.sql
```

### Example: Pattern Violation Found in Review

```bash
# Reviewing commit fc041c80, found server action with business logic
# that should be extracted to reusable functions

sqlite3 .pm/tasks.db "INSERT INTO tasks (sprint, spec, task_num, title, type, skills, done_when, description) VALUES
('demo-ready', '03-entity-transitions.md', 14,
'Extract entity-transitions business logic to reusable functions',
'actions',
'server-actions, testing-unit',
'Business logic extracted to reusable functions with unit tests, server actions are thin wrappers',
'Refactor server action to follow pattern: actions should be thin wrappers, business logic in reusable functions.

Current violation (fc041c80): SQL queries directly in handler files.

Create:
- createDealFromBatchInvestor core action
- advanceDealStage core action
- createPostMeetingTask core action

Update handlers to call core actions instead of raw SQL.');"
```

### Task Types for Review Findings

| Finding Type | task.type | Example |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| Architecture violation | `actions` | Lambda business logic → core |
| Missing tests | `e2e` or `docs` | Coverage gap |
| Security issue | `infra` or `actions` | RLS policy missing |
| Performance issue | `database` or `infra` | Missing index, N+1 query |
| Documentation gap | `docs` | Missing skill documentation |

### Key Principle

**Don't create backlog files for actionable tech debt.** If it's worth tracking, it's worth a task in tasks.db. Backlog is for ideas that aren't yet refined enough to be tasks.

---

## Phase 5: Monitor Sprint Progress

**Trigger**: Dev agents are working on tasks

**Action**: Track progress and surface blockers

### Monitor Queries

```bash
# Sprint overview
sqlite3 -header -column .pm/tasks.db "SELECT * FROM sprint_progress WHERE sprint = 'your-sprint';"

# What's blocked?
sqlite3 -header -column .pm/tasks.db "SELECT * FROM blocked_tasks WHERE sprint = 'your-sprint';"

# What needs pattern audit? (dev agents should handle this, but check)
sqlite3 -header -column .pm/tasks.db "SELECT * FROM needs_pattern_audit WHERE sprint = 'your-sprint';"

# What needs verification?
sqlite3 -header -column .pm/tasks.db "SELECT id, title, done_when FROM needs_verification WHERE sprint = 'your-sprint';"

# Refactor audit (technical debt identified)
sqlite3 -header -column .pm/tasks.db "SELECT * FROM refactor_audit WHERE sprint = 'your-sprint';"
```

### Planning Agent Responsibilities During Sprint

- **Unblock tasks**: Resolve external dependencies, clarify requirements
- **Adjust dependencies**: If dev agents discover missing dependencies
- **Coordinate**: If multiple dev agents conflict on same area
- **Track progress**: Regular check-ins on sprint completion %
- **Surface issues**: Alert when blockers pile up or velocity drops

---

## Phase 6: Sprint Completion

**Trigger**: All tasks green and audited (dev agents report completion)

**Template**: See `templates/sprint-completion-report.md` for detailed steps.

**Actions** (planning agent):

### 1. Pre-Cleanup Verification

```bash
# Verify all tasks green and audited
sqlite3 .pm/tasks.db "
  SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'green' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as green,
    SUM(CASE WHEN pattern_audited = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as audited,
    SUM(CASE WHEN verified = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as verified
  FROM tasks WHERE sprint = 'SPRINT_NAME';
"

# Check all specs have "Status: Done" with conclusions
```

### 2. Sprint Verification (verify-agent)

**User spins up a verify-agent agent** to run:
1. **E2E Tests** - functional correctness, diagnose failures via screenshots
2. **Visual Iteration** - temp screenshot tests for UI polish (if UI-heavy sprint)

**Two tools available in verify-agent**:
- **Tool 1**: Run E2E tests, if failure → read screenshot → diagnose → fix → re-run
- **Tool 2**: Write temp test → screenshot page → assess visual issues → fix CSS → iterate

**If verify-agent escalates to bug-workflow**: bug-workflow investigates with temp E2E tests + console capture + database queries, returns findings, verify-agent continues.

### 3. Handle Issues Found

If issues found during verification:

1. **verify-agent fixes directly**: Most issues can be fixed and committed by verify-agent

2. **Escalate to bug-workflow**: If can't diagnose from screenshots, bug-workflow investigates

3. **Create hotfix task**: For complex issues requiring separate task tracking

4. **PM verifies fix**: Re-run affected manual check

**Note**: PM does NOT invoke `/bug-workflow` — that's for dev agents. PM's job is to document the bug and create the task.

### 4. Git Squash (Consolidate Commits)

**Before cleanup, squash commits per task for clean git history.**

```bash
# Preview what will be squashed (dry-run)
./scripts/git/squash-sprint.sh SPRINT_NAME

# Shows:
# [Task #105] 5 commits → 1 commit
# [Task #106] 3 commits → 1 commit
# [Sprint: SPRINT_NAME] 2 commits → 1 commit
# Before: 10 commits | After: 3 commits

# Execute the squash (creates backup branch first)
./scripts/git/squash-sprint.sh SPRINT_NAME --execute
```

**Safety**:
- Dry-run by default (must pass `--execute`)
- Creates backup branch before squashing
- Aborts if commits already pushed to origin

**Result**: One commit per task, clean history for rollback.

### 5. .wm/ Cleanup (Haiku Subagent)

Spawn Haiku subagent to categorize .wm/ files:
- **DELETE**: Sprint-specific notes (task-N-*.md, *-plan.md, *-summary.md)
- **KEEP**: Persistent context, unrelated to sprint
- **DISTILL**: Patterns worth extracting to skills

Execute deletions. PM approves any distillations.

### 6. Tasks.db Cleanup

**No cleanup needed.** Since `tasks.db` is gitignored and local to each developer:
- Each developer keeps their own progress
- No merge conflicts
- Delete completed sprint's tasks locally when you want: `DELETE FROM tasks WHERE sprint = 'old-sprint';`
- Or just keep them — they don't affect anything

### 7. Specs Cleanup

```bash
rm .pm/todo/<sprint>/*
rmdir .pm/todo/<sprint>
```

### 8. Sprint Retrospective

Document briefly:
- **Patterns emerged**: What was codified in skills?
- **What worked well**: Process improvements
- **What didn't work**: Friction points
- **Next sprint**: Considerations to carry forward

## Schema Reference

### Tasks Table

**Primary Key**: `(sprint, task_num)` — task numbers are unique within a sprint.

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `sprint` | TEXT | Sprint name (part of PK) |
| `spec` | TEXT | Spec file name (e.g., `'01-deals-pipeline.md'`) |
| `task_num` | INTEGER | Task number within sprint (part of PK) |
| `title` | TEXT | What to do |
| `description` | TEXT | Context (executable in isolation) |
| `done_when` | TEXT | What makes this done |
| `status` | TEXT | TDD stages: `pending` → `red` → `green` (or `blocked`) |
| `blocked_reason` | TEXT | Why task is blocked (if status = blocked) |
| `type` | TEXT | database, actions, frontend, infra, agent, e2e, docs |
| `owner` | TEXT | Engineer assigned |
| `skills` | TEXT | Comma-separated skills to invoke (e.g., `'database, server-actions'`) |
| `pattern_audited` | BOOLEAN | Dev agent audited patterns after implementation |
| `pattern_audit_notes` | TEXT | What patterns were found/documented |
| `skills_updated` | BOOLEAN | Dev agent updated relevant skills |
| `skills_update_notes` | TEXT | What skill updates were made |
| `tests_pass` | BOOLEAN | All tests passing |
| `testing_posture` | TEXT | Grade: A, B, C, D, F (target: A)

### Dependencies Table

```sql
task_dependencies (sprint, task_num, depends_on_sprint, depends_on_task)
```

### Views

| View | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `available_tasks` | Pending tasks with no unfinished dependencies |

---

## Quick Reference

### Initialize Local Database

```bash
# Load schema + sprint tasks
sqlite3 .pm/tasks.db < .pm/schema.sql
sqlite3 .pm/tasks.db < .pm/todo/crm/tasks.sql
```

### Common Queries

```bash
# What's available to work on?
sqlite3 -header -column .pm/tasks.db "SELECT sprint, task_num, title, owner FROM available_tasks;"

# List all tasks in a sprint
sqlite3 -header -column .pm/tasks.db "SELECT task_num, title, status, type, owner FROM tasks WHERE sprint = 'crm-foundation' ORDER BY task_num;"

# Mark task in progress
sqlite3 .pm/tasks.db "UPDATE tasks SET status = 'in_progress' WHERE sprint = 'crm-foundation' AND task_num = 5;"

# Mark task done
sqlite3 .pm/tasks.db "UPDATE tasks SET status = 'done' WHERE sprint = 'crm-foundation' AND task_num = 5;"
```

## Separation of Concerns

### PM Role (this skill):
- Create specs
- Audit existing code
- Break specs into tasks
- Set dependencies
- Audit task structure (pre/post load)
- Monitor sprint progress
- Unblock tasks
- Verify sprint completion

### Implementation Role (`tdd-agent` skill):
- Invoke `/tdd-agent`
- Pick available tasks
- Implement with TDD (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- Run quality checks
- Execute 3-subagent audits (subagents for auditing only)
- Update tasks.db with status and findings
- Report blockers
- Move to next task

**Key principle**: PM orchestrates, implementation happens in main chat (or parallel tabs as needed).
