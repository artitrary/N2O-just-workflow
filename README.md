# N2O AI Development Workflows

A multi-agent development system that coordinates planning, implementation, and debugging
through a shared SQLite task database. Achieves 4-5x productivity gains — see
[BENEFITS.md](./BENEFITS.md) for why N2O is investing in this.

## The Three Agents

| Agent | Purpose | Invoke |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **pm-agent** | Sprint planning, spec writing, task breakdown | `/pm-agent` |
| **tdd-agent** | TDD implementation with automated auditing | `/tdd-agent` |
| **bug-workflow** | Root cause investigation and debugging | `/bug-workflow` |

## Repository Structure

| Directory | What's in it |
|-----------|-------------|
| `01-getting-started/` | Overview, workflow, quickstart, setup |
| `02-agents/` | Agent skill definitions (pm, tdd, bug) |
| `03-patterns/` | Coding standards (React, web design) |
| `scripts/` | Git commit automation |
| `.pm/` | SQLite schema, sprint specs, task seeds |
| `specs/` | Product specifications |

## Quick Start

\`\`\`bash
# 1. Create directories
mkdir -p .pm/todo .wm

# 2. Initialize task database
sqlite3 .pm/tasks.db < .pm/schema.sql

# 3. Start planning
/pm-agent create a spec for [your feature]

# 4. Start implementing
/tdd-agent
\`\`\`

See `01-getting-started/` for detailed setup and workflow guides.
